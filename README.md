JuliaWorkshop
=============

Materials for a workshop on Julia programming at UW-Madison Statistics Dept. in June 2014

Files with an `.ipynb` extension are IJulia notebooks.  If you have ipython installed then
add the package
```julia
Pkg.add("IJulia")
```
to be able to work with these notebooks.  You can view the notebooks at

(http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dmbates/JuliaWorkshop/)

In the July 8 session I will cover an example of bootstrapping.
